
# SwEnt Milestone 1 Feedback

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

We looked at several aspects, grouped into three categories: app design, app quality & delivery, and Scrum.

# App Design

## Architecture

We looked at the high-level design of your app. We checked whether the UI, data layer, and corresponding dependencies are present. We evaluated whether your architecture diagram is of good quality and reflects the architecture of the app.

The separation between the different layer (UI, Domain and Data) is not very clear. I would recommend you to have a look again at the documentation in android to understand precisely what are those three layers. (https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), and at the example diagram provided in M1 deliverable (https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/assets/sample-schematic-diagram-features.png). The link between each layer is not very clear either.

For this part, you received 0 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Implementation

We looked at several implementation aspects, such as whether authentication is done safely, whether all sensitive data is properly safeguarded using crypto and secure APIs, and whether the permissions requested by your app are truly needed.

Great implementation of the google authentication provider to sign in user.
There is no API keys visible in clear in the code.
The permission are corrrectly requested, no additional permission than the one required are requested.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Figma

We reviewed how you used Figma in these first Sprints of your project. We took into account whether you had done wireframes and mockups, whether these contained the main application flows and the core features, and whether the screens were linked. Overall, we wanted to see whether it's clear how the pieces work together.

The main user stories have succesfully been designed on figma, great job!
The navigation in the wireframe is well implemented, all the screens are well conected.

For this part, you received 15 points out of a maximum of 15.

## UI

We checked whether the elements of your app's UI are consistent (fonts, colors, etc.) and whether the layout is responsive (i.e., adapts to different screen sizes and orientations).

UI looks good! Well done
Layout from portrait to landscape takes alot of time to render (black screen first and then eventually renders). No scroll possible when putting in landscape mode. Moreover, layout in landscape mode is not ideal on all screens. You should work on that

For this part, you received 2 points out of a maximum of 5.

# Quality & Delivery

## Automated Testing

We looked at whether you configured your CI to integrate with Sonar, whether your CI passes, and of course whether your CI automatically runs the test suite. Then we checked the statement coverage achieved by your test suite. We also looked at whether you have at least one meaningful UI test per screen, one meaningful unit test per repository, one meaningful unit test per view-model, and one meaningful end-to-end test.

The CI runs sonar, but the coverage is not properly reported to SonarCloud.
The coverage is of 65%.
No UI tests were written for the FriendsListScreen, the WelcomeScreen, nor for the SettingsScreen. All other screens had UI tests written for them, keep it up!
No unit tests were written for the HandLandMarkRepository.
No unit tests were written for the HandLandMarkViewModel. You did a good job on writing tests for the UserViewModel, good job. 
You did not write an end-to-end test. An end-to-end test should simulate a specific user story, from start to finish, by simulating real user interactions. It ensures that all components—UI, database, network, and back-end services—work together correctly. This type of test validates user flows and critical paths to confirm that the app performs as expected in real-world scenarios, helping to catch integration issues that unit or integration tests might miss.

For this part, you received 13 points out of a maximum of 33.

## Automated Delivery

We checked whether you have set up your CI to automatically build the APK, and it does so successfully. We also wanted to see if the APK could be installed and run on a real device.

Your CI should automatically generate the apk.
We were able to successfully run your app on an android device!

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 7.

## End-to-End Application Behavior

We then interacted with your app manually, this was fun. We flagged any problems we encountered, such as crashes or bugs, and we classified the bugs into minor vs. major bugs.

No major bugs, well done!
No crash, good job!

For this part, you have been penalized 0 points.

# Scrum

## Documents

The main things we looked for was whether you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up in a timely and thorough manner.

Good job on the standup minutes and the team retro, keep it up.

For this part, you received 10 points out of a maximum of 10.

## Backlogs & Planning

We analyzed your product backlog, Sprint 3 backlog, and the Scrum board. For the PB, we checked whether it was up-to-date and whether you had populated it with user stories for the first epic and for a second epic. For the Sprint 3 backlog, we looked at whether it was up-to-date and whether the task descriptions were clear. We looked at whether tasks were assigned, whether they had a time estimate, and whether they had a priority. Finally, we evaluated whether your
Scrum board was up-to-date and ready for Sprint 3.

Your product backlog is filled with many things and the descriptions are clear, however, as we mentionned during the meetings you should have epics and user stories in the product backlog and the titles should be "epic:..." and "user story:...". Nice job on putting priorities on your items, keep it up!
There are no epcis in your product backlog, you should have epics in the product backlog and write user stories for them and then split the useer stories into different tasks that you will work on during your respective sprints. 
Good job on creating tasks in your sprint 3 backlog, however you don't have enough tasks in your sprint backlog for everyone.
Not all tasks have a clear description. 
Tasks are not assigned to everyone in sprint backlog.
you should assign all tasks to at least one person in your sprint backlogs!
you should put time estimates for all tasks in your sprint backlogs, some are missing
Good job on putting a priority for all tasks in your sprint 3 backlog, keep doing that.

For this part, you received 10 points out of a maximum of 20.

Based on the above points, your intermediate grade for this milestone M1 is 4.00. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/private/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
