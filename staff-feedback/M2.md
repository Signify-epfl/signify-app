# Milestone M2: Team Feedback

This milestone M2 provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on two major themes:
First, whether you have adopted good software engineering practices and are making progress toward delivering value to your users.
Is your design and implementation of high quality, easy to maintain, and well tested?
Second, we look at how well you are functioning as a team, how you organize yourselves, and how well you have refined your collaborative development.
An important component is also how much you have progressed, as a team, since the previous milestone.
You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document.
As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

We looked at several aspects, grouped as follows:

 - Design
   - [Features](#design-features)
   - [Design Documentation](#design-documentation)
 - [Implementation and Delivery](#implementation-and-delivery)
 - Scrum
   - [Backlogs Maintenance](#scrum-backlogs-maintenance)
   - [Documentation and Ceremonies](#scrum-documentation-and-ceremonies)
   - [Continuous Delivery of Value](#scrum-continuous-delivery-of-value)

## Design: Features

We interacted with your app from a user perspective, assessing each implemented feature and flagging any issues encountered. Our evaluation focused mainly on essential features implemented during Sprints 3, 4, and 5; any additional features planned for future Sprints were not considered in this assessment unless they induced buggy behavior in the current APK.
We examined the completeness of each feature in the current version of the app, and how well it aligns with user needs and the overall project goals.


Feature Complexity and Impact: Great job identifying and implementing impactful features! Keep up the good work. Remember to review our feedback on your app's overall flow to ensure a cohesive experience. You're on the right track!  

Feature Completeness: It’s clear you have plenty of creative ideas for new features, which is fantastic. However, some features seem only partially implemented (e.g., the history of challenges and challenges screen, where challenges can't actually be completed, or the "My Stats" page, which isn't functional). Focusing on completing these features will significantly enhance the user experience.

Feature Value: While your enthusiasm for adding features is commendable, prioritization could use some adjustment. For instance, implementing a bug report form before key features like "Your Daily Quests" (which helps users train specific letters) or making the "My Stats" page usable might have detracted from your app's core functionality. With so much happening in your app, it’s easy to lose focus—but stepping back to prioritize the most critical features will make a big difference.

## Design: Documentation

We reviewed your Figma (including wireframes and mockups) and the evolution of your overall design architecture in the three Sprints.
We assessed how you leveraged Figma to reason about the UX, ensure a good UX, and facilitate fast UI development.
We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure.


Figma: there is no screen on your Figma for "report bugs". Other than that your Figma is up to date with your app, well done! To have more points you should keep Figma ahead of your app (parts of the UI that will be implemented soon should be present already; FIGMA FIRST, then implementation)

Architecture Diagram: Overall your diagram is much better than what you gave us for M1, well done. A few things however; We did not understand what is meant by the dictionary UI layer? You can definitely be more precise with your UI layer (add viewmodels). The only problem is with the "domain layer", the domain layer is the core of the application where the business logic resides. It processes data from the data layer, applies the rules and logic specific to the app's purpose, and provides meaningful results to the UI layer. It ensures that the app's functionality is independent of how the data is stored or how the interface looks. In your diagram, the domain layer seems to only describe actions or features but does not clearly highlight its role in processing and transforming data between the UI and Data layers. Putting things in the domain layer is optional so you can definitely omit this layer. Take a look at this: https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer

## Implementation and Delivery

We evaluated several aspects of your app's implementation, including code quality, testing, CI practices, and the functionality and quality of the APK.
We assessed whether your code is well modularized, readable, and maintainable.
We looked at the efficiency and effectiveness of your unit and end-to-end tests, and at the line coverage they achieve.


Code Quality: Good overall, some inconsistencies from time to time but you are on the right track

Tests and CI: No end to end tests were included... This means that we were not able to give you many points for this section

APK: user experience is not always seamless throughout your app. For example in the home page, we coaches believe that it is not really intuitive what we can do. The "Try it out" is not clear, moreover we think it would be better for the user experience to not have to scroll so much on the home page. Something a bit strange that happens is when we click on the (D, E, F, G, H) button the page scrolls first a bit and then again a bit. Moreover when going back to the top we would not expect the you to have reinitialized it to the A letter. When you add a friend a good thing could be to empty the search bar. Maybe prompting the user and asking them if they are sure they want to remove a friend before actually removing is a good idea! Another strange thing is that when when challenging someone, in the "ongoing challenged" tab of the friend that was challenged they see: Opponent: themselves. Also, when clicking on "my friends" from the quests screen we arrive to the profile screen which is a little strange, we think it would be better to see a list of friends.Try and be consistent with your wording in the app (ex: new friends demands that you have combined with "no new friend requests" -> instead you should write: "new friend requests" with "no new friend requests"). David and I were not able to create the "T" sign, is it because we are just really bad or..?

## Scrum: Backlogs Maintenance

We looked at whether your Scrum board is up-to-date and well organized.
We evaluated your capability to organize Sprint 6 and whether you provided a clear overview of this planning on the Scrum board.
We assessed the quality of your user stories and epics: are they clearly defined, are they aligned with a user-centric view of the app, and do they suitably guide you in delivering the highest value possible.


Sprint Backlog: Great job! It's great that you have clear descriptions and labels for your tasks. We did notice that the workload is not evenly distributed and most of you don't have enough hours of work attributed. 

Product Backlog: your epics are good now, well done and your product backlog looks really good with great descriptions!! The only thing that is unfortunate is that you should be moving epics/user stories that are finished from the product backlog to done in Sprint i (ex: Login epic is clearly done). Moreover we did not deduct points for this but remember to actually sort the epics by priority physically (the ones with highest priority go at the top)


For this part, you received 3.6 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Documentation and Ceremonies

We assessed how you used the Scrum process to organize yourselves efficiently.
We looked at how well you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up during each Sprint.
We also evaluated your autonomy in using Scrum.


Scrum Documents: great scrum documents, well done

Scrum meetings: Meetings contribute well to the sprint planning and improvement, however the engagement from you does vary and is not always great, which sometimes limits individual and team growth

Autonomy: Concerning our scrum meetings, we feel like we can advance well with you, well done! For the next meetings (until the end of the course) we expect more autonomy during meetings from you. This means that we coaches should not have to intervene much anymore. You start with the demo, then you move onto the sprint review, then the sprint retro and finally the sprint planning (as discussed, you can do the planning before the meeting and just do a final check up during the meeting so we can also see that everyone knows what they will be working on). The scrum master should mediate the meeting (as David and I were doing). Don't hesitate to ask us if you don't understand what we mean.


For this part, you received 3.4 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Continuous Delivery of Value

We evaluated the Increment you delivered at the end of each Sprint, assessing your team’s ability to continuously add value to the app.
This included an assessment of whether the way you organized the Sprints was conducive to an optimal balance between effort invested and delivery of value.


You have delivered consistent value towards the app during this milestone M2 and M1, well done! Keep up the good work and now that midterms are behind you we expect to keep seeing continuous work from you towards your app


For this part, you received 1.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0.
